# Measurement
This repo fully details all of AWQUA's tools for measuring water quality, with each water quality parameter in a separate subdirectory. The performance standards for these devices, and their suggested use in a water quality monitoring program, will be detailed in [Standards](https://github.com/AWQUA/Standards), and methods for communicating the data obtained through these water quality measurement tools will be described in [Communication](https://github.com/AWQUA/Communication). 

For more information see the [wiki](https://github.com/AWQUA/Communication/wiki).
