# Measuring Temperature
##Why
Temperature is an important variable in the treatment of drinking water. While cheap commercial thermometers are already widely available, we aim to provide a range of thermometers that can be easily modified, outfitted with additional sensors, and paired with communications modules for telemetry of data.

##How
We have a range of tested thermometer designs. Current models are listed below, with attribute tags next to their links. Here is a quick explanation of those attribute tags:

[H] Handheld -- device is manually operated and portable  
[D] Desktop -- device is intended for stationary operation  
[B] Battery powered  
[A] Automated  
[WR] Water Resistant -- can be splashed without damaging internal electronics, but _not_ waterproof  
[I_n] Immersible -- waterproof and can withstand immersion to n meters  

* [H][B][`basic-thermometer`](basic-thermometer/) Our most basic model, which can timestamp and store 8000 temperature observations.
