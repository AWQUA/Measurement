# Measuring Turbidity

##Why
Turbidity refers to the dirtiness or cloudiness of a water sample. Typically the majority of cloudiness in a water sample is due to suspended sediments, which can harbor pathogens and hamper the effectiveness of chemical and optical disinfection methods. Thus, while turbidity is not itself harmful, it serves as a simple real-time proxy measurement for water quality. Technicians at water treatment plants regularly measure water turbidity before and after treatment. Itâ€™s a legal requirement in many countries, and one indicator of whether treated water is safe for human consumption.

The unaided eye can distinguish cloudy water from clear water, but even visibly clear samples of water can have dangerous levels of turbidity. The standard tool for measuring turbidity (a turbidimeter) is a complex piece of equipment. Handheld units capable of analyzing a single sample vial cost several hundred dollars; automated units capable of intermittently analyzing samples from a column of flowing water can cost several thousand. An affordable, open-source solution for turbidity sampling would be a major step towards assuring the quality and sustainability of programs that seek to expand global access to treated drinking water.

##How
We have a range of tested turbidimeter designs, from barebones handheld devices to automated inline devices with dynamically updatable operating parameters and long-range data telemetry. Current models are listed below, with attribute tags next to their links. Here is a quick explanation of those attribute tags:

[H] Handheld -- device is manually operated and portable  
[D] Desktop -- device is intended for stationary operation  
[B] Battery powered  
[A] Automated  
[WR] Water Resistant -- can be splashed without damaging internal electronics, but _not_ waterproof  
[I_n] Immersible -- waterproof and can withstand immersion to n meters  

* [H][B][`basic-handheld-turbidimeter`](basic-handheld-turbidimeter/) A simple, effective, lowest-cost device for manual turbidity measurments.
