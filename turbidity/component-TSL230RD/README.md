####**tags: turbidity, TSL230RD, sensors, testing, ...**

##1. Component selection
Selected for turbidity detection. Mentioned in several blog posts and in two patent applications as a potentially suitable sensor for turbidity detection. Sensitive to very hight and low light levels.  
_Completed: 2014 (documentation completed 2015-07-14)_
##2. Breakout board design
**Design logic:**  
Voltage: 2.7-5.5V  
Bypass capacitor value: 100nF  
One Frequency output pin,  two sensitivity selection pins, two frequency scaling pins; output-enable pin
